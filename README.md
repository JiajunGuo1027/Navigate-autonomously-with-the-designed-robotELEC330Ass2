# Navigate-autonomously-with-the-designed-robotELEC330Ass2
The flat exploration robot designed for the ELEC330Ass1 carefully constructed a world of pavilions that represented the interior space and was complete with appropriate sensors. Then, through Gazebo and Rviz, the flat exploration robot autonomously navigated complex indoor environments and mapped the world. Rviz shows what the robot thinks is happening, while Gazebo shows what is actually happening.
